        Sang Ye 嗓曄 <nobr>(1955 - )</nobr> is a journalist, writer, and oral
        historian. Zhang Xinxin 張辛欣 <nobr>(1953 - )</nobr> is a writer,
        novelist, and playwright.

        In 1986, the pair published Chinese Lives 《北京人：一百個普通人的自述》,
        a book of interviews with people from a wide range of social, family, and
        occupational backgrounds, in a country very different to today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Song and Zhang edited themselves out of the interviews, to present their
        subjects' accounts as uninterrupted monologues.
    </p>

        I read the English translation ahead of my first visit to China, and found
        the authors' deeply humane treatment of their subjects' diverse and
        sometimes tragic experiences striking. I was fortunate to later track down
        a second-hand Chinese edition (see <a href="/sources">SOURCES</a> for
        places to search), but the translation is worth reading if that's
        unavailable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sang Ye published a further oral history titled 《1949 1989 1999》, later
        translated to English as China Candid: The People on the People's Republic
        by <a href="#ChinaHeritage">China&nbsp;Heritage</a> founder Gereme Barmé,
        and Miriam Lang.
