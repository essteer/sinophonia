    <p>
        Sanmao 三毛 was the pseudonym of Echo Chen Ping 陳平 (1943 - 1991), a
        writer and translator. Her then-unconventional lifestyle, which saw her
        leave Taiwan alone for Europe and Morocco, embodied a free and independent
        way of life that inspired many across the Chinese-speaking world.

        Stories of the Sahara 《撒哈拉的故事》 is typical of her autobiographical
        writing style, based on her experiences living in Morocco with her Spanish
        husband, who passed away in an accident just a few years after
        publication. Her struggles to cope with this loss informed much of her
        subsequent work, and likely contributed to her suicide a decade later.
