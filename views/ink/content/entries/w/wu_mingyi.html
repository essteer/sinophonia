        professor of Chinese literature at National Dong Hwa University

        The Stolen Bicycle 《單車失竊記》 revolves around a man seeking his
        long-absent father, with meditations on Taiwan's role in World War II. His
        meticulous effort to piece together whatever fragments he can - down to
        cataloguing bicycles used in the theatre his father served in - vividly
        contrasts the inability to know the person at the centre of his search.
