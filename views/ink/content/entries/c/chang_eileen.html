        Eileen Chang 張愛玲 (1920 - 1995), also known as Zhang Ailing, was a
        novelist, screenwriter, and essayist, and a major figure in 20th century
        Chinese literature.

        Zhang's works remain widely read in the Chinese-language world today, many
        of them focused on the 1930s to 1940s of the Republican era. She is
        perhaps best known overseas as the author of Lust, Caution 《色，戒》,
        which Ang Lee 李安 adapted for the screen in 2007. Her novel Naked Earth
        《赤地戀愛》, one of few translated into English, depicts a young couple
        separated by Party bureaucracy and the Korean War.

        In addition to her fiction, she was an active translator, and her research
        on Cao Xueqin's 曹雪芹 Dream of the Red Chamber 《紅樓夢》 is credited
        with having revived scholarly interest in the classic novel.
