    <p>Chen Hsueh 陳雪 (1970 - ) is a novelist and short story writer.</p>
    <p>
        Her 1995 collection Vile Girls Book 《惡女書》 explores its protagonists'
        struggles to accept their non-conventional sexuality, amid strained family
        ties and social stigma.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strongest of the stories are Looking for Lost Angel Wings
        <nobr>《尋找天使遺失的翅膀》</nobr> and After the Cat Died
        <nobr>《貓死了之後》,</nobr> which speak directly through first-person
        narratives, whereas the magical realist style of the other two seems to
        dilute the impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        In one passage of Night Maze 《夜的迷宮》 Chen composes across the page in
        rows and columns simultaneously, an unusual technique that gives a
        stream-of-consciousness-like feel. It would be interesting to see this
        developed to greater effect.

        Since gaining infamy for the controversy of Vile Girls Book, her debut
        work - published in a less tolerant Taiwan, over two decades before it
        legalised same-sex marriage - Chen has spoken of her desire not to be
        typified as a genre writer. Chen is a prolific writer with several
        acclaimed full-length novels, some of which are on
        <a href="/ink/moreink">this list</a>.
