    <p>
      Xuanzang 玄奘 is an introduction to writers and podcasts from across the
      Sinophone world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is intended as a resource for non-native Chinese-language
      speakers seeking native content - as opposed to materials created for
      students.
    </p>
    <p id="text-box">
      For more on the concept behind the site, see <a href="/about">ABOUT</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content is grouped below as either written or audio, with a third section
      of links to places to get hold of materials.

      If something's included in these pages, it could be for a range of reasons
      - but most likely it's due to its entertainment value, cultural
      significance, social or historical insight, or a combination of these
      factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice of content is limited to what I've personally read or listened
      to, so it's inevitable that many excellent creators have been overlooked
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're looking for more, a longer list of writers is included at the
      end of <a href="/ink">INK</a>, or see the tips under
      <a href="/voice">VOICE</a> on searching for podcasts.
