      Introductions to writers and podcasts from across the Sinophone world.

      The site is intended to help non-native Chinese-language speakers seek out
      quality content - mostly in Mandarin, but there's a small selection of
      Cantonese content that I hope will grow over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature is the main focus of the writing section, but non-fiction
      across economics, history, politics, and sociology is also featured, as
      are several excellent online archives that cover an extensive range.
    </p>

      For more on the concept behind the site, see <a href="/about">ABOUT</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content is grouped below as either written or audio, with a third section
      of links to places to get hold of materials.

      Works are typically included in these pages due to their entertainment
      value, cultural significance, social or historical insight, or a
      combination of these factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content is chosen from what I've personally read or listened to, so
      it's inevitable that many excellent creators have been overlooked here.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more ideas, a longer list of writers is included at the end of
      <a href="/ink">INK</a>, or see the tips under
      <a href="/voice">VOICE</a> on searching for podcasts.
