        <span id="name">XUANZANG</span> <span class="chinese-heading">玄奘</span> is an ongoing project to highlight
        quality Chinese-language creators and content. Mandarin is the predominant medium here, but there's a limited
        Cantonese selection and plans to feature more works beyond these in time.

        Modern literature is the main focus of <span id="name">INK</span> <span class="chinese-heading">墨</span> but
        economics, history, politics and sociology are also featured, as are several excellent online archives
        that cover an extensive range.
      </p>
      <p>
        The podcasts in <span id="name">VOICE</span> <span class="chinese-heading">嗓</span> include series that vary in
        scope from oral histories and political commentary, to philosophy and pop culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content is chosen from what I've personally read or listened to, and typically included based on cultural
        significance, entertainment value, social or historical insight, or a combination of these factors.

        It's inevitable that many excellent creators and works have been overlooked here &mdash; ping feedback and
