        With this 160-part series, Chiang Hsun <nobr>蔣勳</nobr> (intro
        <a href="/ink#Chiang%20Hsun">here</a>) provides a detailed guide through
        Dream of the Red Chamber <nobr>《紅樓夢》,</nobr> the classic Qing dynasty
        novel by Cao Xueqin <nobr>曹雪芹.</nobr>

        A former professor of fine arts at Taiwan's Tunghai University 東海大學,
        Chiang Hsun proceeds through the novel from cover to cover, offering rich
        explanations of the cultural and historical context of the narrative,
        bringing it to life in vivid detail. The result is comparable to the late
        Frank Delaney's analysis of James Joyce's Ulysses in his
        <a href="https://blog.frankdelaney.com/re-joyce/" target="_blank">Re: Joyce podcast</a>, which sadly remains
        incomplete due to his passing in 2017.

        Chiang Hsun is an engaging speaker with deep knowledge of the subjects he
        covers here and elsewhere, and is enjoyable to listen to in his own right.

        Classical Chinese can be difficult to grasp even for native
        Chinese-language speakers today. This podcast offers a good alternative to
        reading the novel directly, and would be a useful companion for non-native
        speakers interested in taking it on.
