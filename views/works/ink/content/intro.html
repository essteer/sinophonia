    Suggestions for writers and works to read in Chinese languages &mdash; mostly
    Mandarin, with some exceptions.

    The writers introduced include novelists across a range of genres,
    essayists, sociologists, historians, journalists, and others. Also listed
    are projects that provide access to writing alongside academic research
    and cultural commentary.

    Since first beginning to learn Chinese, I've sought out reading
    recommendations from friends and native speakers.
</p>
<p>
    Over time I've developed my own sense of how and where to seek out content
    I'm interested in &mdash; something I tend to take for granted in my native
    language.
</p>
<p>
    Tastes differ and there are of course many other writers worth spending
    time with; these are shared here to point towards those I've got something
    out of, and in some cases to promote lesser-known writers or books
    deserving of a broader audience.
