        His first novel, Desertion 《遺棄》, uses a first-person narrative to
        explore the protagonist's philosophical reflections, as he struggles
        against bureaucratic opposition to quit his vacuous government job.

        With Shenzheners 《深圳人》, Xue took inspiration from James Joyce's
        Dubliners to produce these short stories on fictional residents of the
        Chinese city.
