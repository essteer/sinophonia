      This is a brief introduction to places to search for books and podcasts,
      with some resources for further study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your usual bookstore, website or podcast app may already have what you're
      looking for, but for many books and podcasts you will need to look
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platforms introduced below are a good place to start, and generally
      have a wide selection of Chinese-language content available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that these are suggestions only - Xuanzang is not affiliated with any
      of these links, and you should exercise the usual caution when visiting
      unfamiliar sites to make downloads or purchases.

      Xuanzang is oriented towards native Chinese-language content and places to
      get hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you're looking for study materials or guidance on how to
      improve your Chinese, below is a short list of apps and tools I've found
      useful over the years.
    </p>
    <p class="fst-italic" id="text-box">
      Some of the platforms listed below provide paid as well as free services.
      You may find the added content worth the price, but it is entirely
      possible to learn to an advanced level with these tools without spending
      any money.

      <p>
        Olle Linge has built an excellent site and community at Hacking Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used his site for many years in the past, which is full of guidance on
        different approaches to the language, and the many tools available to
        help improve specific skills such as reading and writing.

        <a href="https://www.pleco.com/" target="_blank">Pleco</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pleco is a Chinese dictionary app, available on the App Store and Google
        Play. The free version is excellent, and the premium version is well
        worth the price.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can easily view definitions from multiple dictionaries at once,
        including several with definitions in Chinese (useful for an immersive
        approach). The app has audio support, example sentences, and a flashcard
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began using Pleco over a decade ago for Mandarin, and still use it on
        a daily basis for that and more recently Cantonese as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is without doubt the single most useful tool I have made use of, and
        has made the process of learning to read and expand vocabulary far more
        smooth and enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.
