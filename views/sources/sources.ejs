      This is a brief intro to places to search for books and podcasts, and some
      tools for those interested in further study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your usual bookstore, website or podcast app may already have what you're
      looking for, but for many books and podcasts you will need to look
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platforms introduced below are a good place to start, and generally
      have a wide selection of Chinese-language content available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that these are suggestions only - Xuanzang is not affiliated with any
      of these links, and you should exercise the usual caution when visiting
      unfamiliar sites to make downloads or purchases.

      In Chinese-speaking countries, you'll find independent bookstores and
      chains in any city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overseas, large stores in international or student cities may stock a
      limited range -
      <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/" target="_blank">Foyles</a> in London,
      for example, has a small selection of Chinese-language fiction and
      non-fiction, as well as study materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the majority of situations, online sellers such as those below offer
      convenient access to the widest selection.

      Xuanzang is oriented towards native Chinese-language content and places to
      get hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you're looking for study materials or guidance on how to
      improve your Chinese, below is a short list of apps and tools I've found
      useful over the years.
    </p>
    <p class="fst-italic" id="text-box">
      Some of the platforms below provide paid as well as free services. You may
      find the added content worth the price, but it is entirely possible to
      learn to an advanced level with these or other tools without spending
      money.
    </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
        Olle Linge has built an excellent site and community at Hacking Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used his site for many years in the past, which is full of guidance on
        different approaches to the language, and the many tools available to
        help improve specific skills such as reading and writing.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h4 class="fs-5 mt-4 text-start">
        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Anki is a flashcard platform that uses spaced repition software - see
        Benny Lewis'
        <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/"
          >explainer</a
        >
        if you're new to the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be used for all kinds of subjects - it's supposedly popular with
        medical students for learning clinical terms - and is especially useful
        for building vocabulary in a foreign language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either download flashcard decks created by others, or build your own
        over time and add new terms as you come across them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anki is free on desktop systems and Android, but there is a one-off fee
        for the iPhone version.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4 class="fs-5 mt-4 text-start">
        <a href="https://www.italki.com/" target="_blank">iTalki</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        iTalki is a platform for connecting language teachers and students for
        online lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        For popular languages there are many teachers available across different
        time zones and a range of budgets, and it is often possible to have a
        trial lesson with a teacher first before committing to more time with
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site used to offer a free language exchange option, where users
        could find partners to practice conversation in their native languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        That seems to no longer be available, but would be worth seeking out on
        another platform - free conversation practice from anywhere in the world
        and the chance to make friends in your target language is an incredible
        thing.

      <h4 class="fs-5 mt-4 text-start">
        <a href="" target="_blank">Lang-8</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Lang-8 is a platform for improving writing skills in foreign languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users write entries in their target language, and native speakers then
        correct mistakes and provide feedback - the more entries you work on in
        your native language, the more likely your own entries will receive
        corrections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately Lang-8 no longer accepts new registrations, but the same
        company has an app called
        <a href="https://hinative.com/">HiNative</a> that appears to offer
        similar features.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4 class="fs-5 mt-4 text-start">
        <a href="https://www.pleco.com/" target="_blank">Pleco</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Pleco is a Chinese dictionary app, available on the App Store and Google
        Play. The free version is excellent, and the premium version is well
        worth the price.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can easily view definitions from multiple dictionaries at once,
        including several with definitions in Chinese (useful for an immersive
        approach). The app has audio support, example sentences, and a flashcard
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began using Pleco over a decade ago for Mandarin, and still use it on
        a daily basis for that and more recently Cantonese as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is without doubt the single most useful tool I have made use of, and
        has made the process of learning to read and expand vocabulary far more
        smooth and enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.
