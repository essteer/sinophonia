        Begun in mid-2022,
        <a href="https://www.bumingbai.net/" target="_blank">Bu Mingbai</a>
        <nobr>不明白</nobr> is the personal project of a group of professional
        journalists, hosted by New York Times reporter Yuan Li <nobr>袁莉</nobr>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the words of its creators, the Bu Mingbai podcast "hopes to share
        interesting conversations with a global Chinese-language audience, to
        shine a little light and warmth during this dark and chaotic era."
    </p>

        Yuan Li interviews guests from a range of professional and social
        backgrounds, and also asks each guest for their book recommendations,
        making it a good source for reading suggestions. Episodes last around an
        hour each.
