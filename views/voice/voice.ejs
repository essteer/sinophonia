      Podcasts offer convenient access to Chinese-language content on almost any
      subject imaginable, and a broader range of perspectives than offered via
      official media channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The series listed here include several that share the personal stories of
      ordinary people, and explore their views on current socio-political
      developments, making them good sources for insight into discussions across
      the Sinophone world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond those listed below, simple search terms for your area of interest -
      such as 電影 or 新聞 - will likely return several options on any major
      podcast platform.

      Begun in mid-2022,
      <a href="https://www.bumingbai.net/" target="_blank">Bu Mingbai</a> 不明白
      is the personal project of a group of professional journalists, hosted by
      New York Times reporter Yuan Li 袁莉.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the words of its creators, the Bu Mingbai podcast "hopes to share
      interesting conversations with a global Chinese-language audience, to
      shine a little light and warmth during this dark and chaotic era."
    </p>
    <p>
      Episodes last around an hour each, and have explored topics such as the
      "Those Little Upstarts: Why We Took to the Streets"
      《那些年輕的抗議者：我們爲什麽要上街》, "Sino-American AI Competition Seen
      Through ChatGPT" 《從ChatGPT看中美人工智能競爭》, "A Year of War in
      Ukraine, What Lessons for Taiwan?" 《俄烏戰爭一周年，台灣學到了什麽？》,
      and "Ancient China's Female Reformers" 《中國古代的女改革家》.

      Yuan Li often asks guests for their book recommendations, too, making it a
      good source for reading suggestions.

      <h3>Chiang Hsun on Dream of the Red Chamber <br />蔣勳細説紅樓夢</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid col-md-8 text-start mt-3">
    <p>
      With this 160-part series, Chiang Hsun 蔣勳 (intro
      <a href="/ink#Chiang%20Hsun">here</a>) provides a detailed guide through
      Dream of the Red Chamber 紅樓夢, the classic Qing dynasty novel by Cao
      Xueqin 曹雪芹.
    </p>
    <p>
      A former professor of fine arts at Taiwan's Tunghai University 東海大學,
      Chiang Hsun proceeds through the novel from cover to cover, offering rich
      explanations of the cultural and historical context of the narrative,
      bringing it to life in vivid detail. The result is comparable to the late
      Frank Delaney's analysis of James Joyce's Ulysses in his
      <a href="https://blog.frankdelaney.com/re-joyce/" target="_blank"
        >Re: Joyce podcast</a
      >, which sadly remains incomplete due to his passing in 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiang Hsun is an engaging speaker with deep knowledge of the subjects he
      covers here and elsewhere, and is enjoyable to listen to in his own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classical Chinese can be difficult to grasp even for native
      Chinese-language speakers today. This podcast offers a good alternative to
      reading the novel directly, and would be a useful companion for non-native
      speakers interested in taking it on.

    <p>
      Launched in 2020, the hosts of Dagong Tan 打工談 ("Labour Talks") spend
      time with manual labourers and people from other working-class
      professions, to discuss how they make their living, their perspective on
      their position in society, and obtacles they face in their work and
      personal lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Episodes include "I'm a Shenzhen Courier: 30,000 Steps, and
      Thousand-Dollar Fines" 《我在深圳送快遞：日行三萬步，罰款上千元》, "Seven
      Ways to Live: What Do You Mean, Work-Life Balance?"
      《七種生活：工作自由在哪裏？》, and "There's Nothing New About a Migrant
      Worker Reflecting on Labour" 《一個農民工思考勞工問題是再正常不過的事》.
    </p>
    <P
      >The hosts show genuine interest in getting to know their guests and
      portray their experiences with dignity, in defiance of the prevailing
      social mood towards the so-called "low-end population" 低端人口
      responsible for the PRC's prosperity.</P

      podcast series that relays personal narratives from ordinary people in
      their own words. With its 700th episode released in early 2023, it is an

    <p>
      Most episodes run from 20 to 40 minutes, and the titles below give a sense
      of the breadth of content: "What I Learnt Loan-Sharking"

      《一個關於衰老、死亡、與生命尊嚴的故事》, "I'm a Drug Dealer's Daughter"
      《我是毒販的女兒》, and "Entrepreneurialism 101: Raising Pigs with
      Science" 《創業經：如何科學養豬》.
