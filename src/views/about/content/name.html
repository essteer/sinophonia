<h2 class="h2-bilingual">On the Name&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">誰爲玄奘</span></h2>
<p>
    This site is named in homage to Xuanzang <span class="person-zh">玄奘</span><sub
        class="life-date">602&mdash;664</sub>, a
    Buddhist monk, scholar and translator during the late Sui <nobr>隋朝<sub class="life-date">581&mdash;618</sub>
    </nobr>
    and early Tang <nobr>唐朝<sub class="life-date">618&mdash;907</sub></nobr>
    dynasties, and major contributor to the development of Buddhism in East
    Asia.
</p>
<p>
    Dissatisfied with the fragmented translations of scripture available to
    him, Xuanzang defied a ban on foreign travel to visit India so that he could
    access the original texts.
</p>
<p>
    He returned to the Tang capital Chang'an <nobr>長安</nobr> &mdash; modern-day Xi'an <nobr>西安</nobr> &mdash;
    17 years later with hundreds of texts, and founded an institute to
    translate them.
</p>
<p>
    His account of his travels, <span class="title-en">Great Tang Records on the Western Regions</span><span
        class="title-zh">大唐西域記</span> is comparable to Herodotus'<sub class="life-date">c.484&mdash;c.425</sub>

    of the people and cultures he encountered and heard tales of.

    Nine centuries after Xuanzang's death, his life inspired Wu Cheng'en's

<p>
    In the present geopolitical climate, culture is overlooked in the
    dehumanising process of conflating states' actions with their citizens'
    attitudes.
</p>
<p>
    Media focus is often limited to politics (understandably) or vulgar
    incidents (regrettably), and few contemporary Chinese-language voices find
    an overseas audience through translation.
</p>
<p>
    Among the small but growing number of foreign Mandarin speakers &mdash; let
    alone the other dialects or languages of Chinese &mdash; engagement with native
    cultural output seems rarer still, perhaps due to intimidation by the
    perceived difficulty of the language, or perhaps to unfamiliarity and lack
    of exposure.
</p>
<p>
    The ambition of these pages is much more limited in scope than Xuanzang's,
    but I hope to share content that will be useful to others in their
    effort to encounter a diverse range of voices in their own words.
