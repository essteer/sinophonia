        For new Chinese-language speakers seeking native materials to engage with,
        the volume of media available can make it difficult to find works that
        suit their interests and taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is exacerbated by the fact that original works that grapple with
        their creators' environment often fall foul of censors, or are deterred
        from being created in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effort to engage is worthwhile. There are a wealth of contemporary
        artists and thinkers who convey deep human and social insights with
        dignity, humour, and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of those whose form of self-expression is hazardous, their
        willingness to persist in spite of great personal risk makes their voices especially deserving
        of an audience.

    <h2 class="h2-bilingual">On the Name&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">誰爲玄奘</span></h2>
    <p>
        This site is named in homage to Xuanzang <span class="person-zh">玄奘</span><sub
            class="life-date">602&mdash;664</sub>, a
        Buddhist monk, scholar and translator during the late Sui <nobr>隋朝<sub class="life-date">581&mdash;618</sub>
        </nobr>
        and early Tang <nobr>唐朝<sub class="life-date">618&mdash;907</sub></nobr>
        dynasties, and major contributor to the development of Buddhism in East
        Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dissatisfied with the fragmented translations of scripture available to
        him, Xuanzang defied a ban on foreign travel to visit India so that he could
        access the original texts.
    </p>
    <p>
        He returned to the Tang capital Chang'an <nobr>長安</nobr> &mdash; modern-day Xi'an <nobr>西安</nobr> &mdash;
        17 years later with hundreds of texts, and founded an institute to
        translate them.
    </p>
    <p>
        His account of his travels, <span class="title-en">Great Tang Records on the Western Regions</span><span
            class="title-zh">大唐西域記</span> is comparable to Herodotus'<sub class="life-date">c.484&mdash;c.425</sub>

        documentation
        of the people and cultures he encountered and heard tales of.

        Nine centuries after Xuanzang's death, his life inspired Wu Cheng'en's

    <p>
        In the present geopolitical climate, culture is overlooked in the
        dehumanising process of conflating states' actions with their citizens'
        attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Media focus is often limited to politics (understandably) or vulgar
        incidents (regrettably), and few contemporary Chinese-language voices find
        an overseas audience through translation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among the small but growing number of foreign Mandarin speakers &mdash; let
        alone the other dialects or languages of Chinese &mdash; engagement with native
        cultural output seems rarer still, perhaps due to intimidation by the
        perceived difficulty of the language, or perhaps to unfamiliarity and lack
        of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ambition of these pages is far humbler than Xuanzang's achievements,
        but I hope the content shared here will be useful to others in their
        effort to encounter a diverse range of voices in their own words.
