    The writers and publications introduced here are drawn from a broad range that includes novelists,
    essayists, sociologists, historians and journalists.
</p>
<p>
    Also present are archives and organisations that feature Chinese-language works as well as academic research
    and cultural commentary on the context around them. These are valuable resources that offer a level of insight and
    genuine pursuit of understanding far beyond that of the typical China book of the month.
