    The writers and publications introduced here are drawn from a broad range that includes novelists,
    essayists, sociologists, historians and journalists.
</p>
<p>
    Also present are archives and organisations that feature Chinese-language works as well as academic research
    and cultural commentary on the context around them. These are valuable resources that offer a level of insight and
    genuine pursuit of understanding far beyond that of the typical China book of the month.

    print editions.

    The entries on this page are shared to signal writers and resources I've found value in &mdash; in whatever respect
    &mdash; as notes to myself and whoever else might be searching.
