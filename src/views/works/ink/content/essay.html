    Since I first began to work towards fluency in Chinese, I set upon the goal of attaining a high level of literacy.
    This is a subjective standard which I define in these terms:
</p>
<ul class="text-points">
    <li>to be able to read the same books and articles as educated native speakers,</li>
    <li>to do so with close to the ease I experience in my mother tongue, and</li>
    <li>to feel something close to what a native speaker might feel when they read them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    That last point sticks out a bit, so to elaborate: the <em>might</em> in "might feel" is key, since <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" class="external-url" target="_blank">I cannot know what I
        don't know</a>. I'll try but won't presume to grasp each nuance and weighted reference &mdash; though it's clear
    this
    applies just as much to one's "own" language, and the best we can do is use these primal tools as a proxy for true
    understanding.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, it's not enough to me to understand what I read at an intellectual level. I want to feel and be stimulated
    by
    writing in this language in the same way that I am when I read my favourite writers in English.
</p>
<p>
    The catch is this: for that to happen, the writing must also be "good" in the first place. As <a
        href="https://chinaheritage.net/journal/why-is-chinese-so-boring/" class="external-url" target="_blank">others have pointed
        out</a>, that "good" stuff is not often offered up to the newcomer &mdash; but it sure is out there.
</p>
<p>
    From the outset I've sought recommendations from friends and other native speakers, and relied on their tastes and
    cultural clairvoyance to filter out the noise. I'm ever grateful for their patience and the many excellent
    "discoveries" made thanks to them.
</p>
<p>
    Over time I've developed my own sense of how and where to seek out writing
    I'm interested in &mdash; something I tend to take for granted in my native
    language.

    The entries on this page are shared to signal writers and resources I've found value in &mdash; in whatever respect
    &mdash; as both notes to myself and a nod to whoever else might be searching.
