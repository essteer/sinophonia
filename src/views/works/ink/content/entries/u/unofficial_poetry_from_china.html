        class="title-en">Unofficial Poetry from China</span></a>
    is a digital archive that houses underground poetry journals and other materials, and which <span class="quote">"is
      unique
      in that it combines a wealth of original material with online, research-driven, English-language documentation and
      contextualisation, and with online catalogue records and accessibility of the actual material to visitors from all
      over the world"</span>.<sup>&nbsp;<a class="note-ref" href="#n001">1</a></sup>

    The collection began in the early 1990s with the doctoral fieldwork of Professor of Chinese Language and
    Literature <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/maghiel-van-crevel"
      class="external-url">Maghiel van
      Crevel</a>, who sought the help of Chinese poets and scholars to acquire what has
    grown to become an extensive range of poetry journals published from the late 1970s to the present. With the
    establishment
    of the online repository, these materials are now freely available in digital format.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notable journals featured in the archive include <span class="title-en">Enlightenment</span><span
      class="title-zh">啓蒙</span>, <span class="title-en">Not-Not</span><span class="title-zh">非非</span> and <span
      class="title-en">Today!</span><span class="title-zh">今天</span>, which have each played important roles in
    launching the reputations of prominent modern poets in recent decades.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to these materials, the archive hosts texts and lectures that introduce the history of the collection,
    the journals it curates, and various poetry movements that have taken place across the PRC over the past century.
