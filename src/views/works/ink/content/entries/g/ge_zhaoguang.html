  <h2>Ge Zhaoguang&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">葛兆光</span></h2>
  <p>
    Ge Zhaoguang <span class="person-zh">葛兆光</span><sub class="life-date">1950</sub> is a professor of history at Fudan
    University 復旦大學, whose extensive scholarship on Chinese religion, thought and culture has spanned numerous
    publications
    and engagements at other prestigious institutions including Harvard, Kyoto, and Tsinghua universities.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <span class="title-en">What is China?</span><span class="title-zh">何爲中國</span> Ge expands on lecture materials
    prepared in the early 2010s to critically examine the question of how to define China today. Despite the broad scope
    of the work &mdash; its subtitle is <span class="title-en">Territory, Ethnicity, Culture and History</span>
    <span>疆域、民族、文化與歷史</span> &mdash; he argues with concision for a nuanced and pluralistic understanding that rejects
    both efforts to fit China into the Western concept of the nation-state, and maximalist interpretations of the past
    that seek to justify present-day political ends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Via cogent analysis and dissection of engaging source materials, Ge offers a clear-eyed view of themes that might
    otherwise give way to abstract or ideological generalisations. Tangential discussions such as his exploration of
    factors that led to Japanese and Korean divergence from China around the late Ming dynasty <nobr>明朝<sub
        class="life-date">1368-1644</sub></nobr> and early Qing <nobr>清朝<sub class="life-date">1644-1911</sub></nobr>
    dynasty are not
    only fascinating, but also add weight to his caution against simplistic readings of history.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, his call to view the past and tradition as resources to enrich modern life, not as tools to constrain or
    control, is deeply humane and significant well beyond the focus of this work alone.
