  <p>
    Feng Tang <span class="person-zh">馮唐</span> is the pseudonym of Zhang Haipeng <span class="person-zh">張海鵬</span><sub
      class="life-date">1971</sub>, a
    writer, poet and private equity investor from Beijing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="title-en">Oneness</span><span class="title-zh">不二</span> depicts Tang dynasty monks and nuns as
    sexual deviants
    with cynical attitudes towards their faith and peers. Feng's explicit
    deadpan humour is reminiscent of the writing of Wang Xiaobo <span class="person-zh">王小波</span><sub
      class="life-date">1952-1997</sub>, and he combines this
    with historical detail and satirical plays on monastic politics to great
    effect.

    The lewd pretext is good fun, but would wear thin if it wasn't matched with such strong execution. Feng
    clearly knows this and keeps the smut at the level of wit and allusion without lapsing into pornography. I came
    away wanting to read more about the real history of the era, which is solid praise for a book that is marketed in
    Hong Kong bookstores as if it were a top-shelf magazine at a newsstand.

    But of course that's part of the fun.
