        Feng Tang <span class="person-zh">馮唐</span> is the pseudonym of Zhang Haipeng <span class="person-zh">張海鵬</span><sub class="life-date">1971</sub>, a
        writer, poet and private equity investor from Beijing.

        <span class="title-en">Oneness</span><span class="title-zh">不二</span> depicts Tang dynasty monks and nuns as
        sexual deviants
        with cynical attitudes towards their faith and peers. Feng's explicit
        deadpan humour is reminiscent of Wang Xiaobo <span class="person-zh">王小波</span><sub class="life-date">1952&mdash;1997</sub>, and he combines this
        with historical detail and satirical plays on monastic politics to great
        effect.
