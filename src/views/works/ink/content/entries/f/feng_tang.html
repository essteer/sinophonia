        Oneness 《不二》 depicts Tang dynasty monks and nuns as sexual deviants
        with cynical attitudes towards their faith and peers. Feng's explicit
        deadpan humour is reminiscent of Wang Xiaobo 王小波, and he combines this
        with historical detail and satirical plays on monastic politics to great
        effect.
