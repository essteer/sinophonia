        Wang Shuo <span class="person-zh">王朔</span></span><sub class="life-date">1958&mdash;</sub> is a novelist and
        screenwriter. Known for his
        <em>liu mang</em> 流氓 or 'hooligan' style of writing, his works have been
        popular source material for film and television since the late 1980s.

        The dark humour of <span class="title-en">Please Don't Call Me Human</span><span class="title-zh">千萬別把我當人</span>
        gets
        close to the bone with its ridicule of totalitarian bureaucracy, through the exploration of a cynical
        protagonist who passively adheres to whatever political directives come his way. Published
        in the 1980s, a similar work could not evade censorship today.

        Wang's writing includes several screenplays that have been adapted for film and television,
        including the absurdist <span class="title-en">The Troubleshooters</span> <span class="title-zh">頑主</span>
        directed by Mi Jiashan 米家山, which follows three founders of a Beijing firm that promises to resolve any problem
        their clients face.
