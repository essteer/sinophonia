    <h2>Wang Mun Kiat&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">黄文杰</span></h2>
    <p>Wang Mun Kiat 黃文傑 (1967 &mdash; ) is a Singaporean poet and engineer.</p>
    <p>
        The poems of his second collection Short Tongue 《短舌》 are haiku-like in
        their brevity, but Wang manages to imbue their clipped lines with barbed
        social commentary.

    <p>
        I've spent little time with Chinese poetry in the past, often finding the
        form's abstract nature to be beyond my language ability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some entries of Short Tongue are cryptic, but in general it's accessible
        and I'd recomend it to others interested in trying poetry in Chinese.
