    <h2>Wang Mun Kiat&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">黄文杰</span></h2>
    <p>Wang Mun Kiat <span class="person-zh">黃文傑</span><sub class="life-date">1967&mdash;</sub> is a Singaporean poet
        and engineer.</p>
    <p>
        The poems of his second collection <span class="title-en">Short Tongue</span><span class="title-zh">短舌</span>
        are haiku-like in
        their brevity, but Wang manages to imbue their clipped lines with barbed
        social commentary. Take for example <span class="title-en">Modern Revelations: Smartphones</span> <span
            class="title-zh">現代啓示錄：智能手機</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="container-center">
        <div class="vertical-panel-narrow text-box-cn">
            <p>
                現代啓示錄：智能手機
            </p>
            <p>
                低頭<br>最多話的<br>啞巴
            </p>
            <p>
                抬頭<br>最孤寂的<br>喧嘩
            </p>

        I've spent little time with Chinese poetry in the past, often finding the
        form's abstract nature to be beyond my language ability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some entries of <span class="title-en">Short Tongue</span> are cryptic, but in general the writing is accessible
        and I'd recommend it to others interested in trying modern poetry in Chinese.
