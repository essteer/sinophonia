        <span class="title-en">The Stolen Bicycle</span><span class="title-zh">單車失竊記</span> revolves around a man seeking his
        long-absent father, with meditations on Taiwan's role in World War II. His
        meticulous effort to piece together whatever fragments he can &mdash; down to
        cataloguing bicycles used in the theatre his father served in &mdash; vividly
        contrasts the inability to know the person at the centre of his search.
