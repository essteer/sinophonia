        Wang Xiaobo <span class="person-zh">王小波</span> (1952 &mdash; 1997) was a novelist and essayist. Born in
        Beijing, he was amongst the many 'sent-down' or 'educated' youths 知識青年
        extracted from urban life to labour in rural areas during the Cultural
        Revolution 文革.

        That experience influenced some of his best-known works, including the
        hilarious satirical novella <span class="title-en">Golden Age</span><span class="title-zh">黃金時代</span>.</p>
    <p>
        Essay collections such as <span class="title-en">Silent
            Majority</span><span class="title-zh">沉默的大多數</span> display his bold wit and talent for
        querying norms, whether via serious critique or darkly comic scenarios.

        Wang was a rare outspoken public intellectual in a society that offered scant room for one. Had he not sadly passed
        before his time, he no doubt would have much to say today.
