        Wang Xiaobo 王小波 (1952 &mdash; 1997) was a novelist and essayist. Born in
        Beijing, he was amongst the many 'sent-down' or 'educated' youths 知識青年
        extracted from urban life to labour in rural areas during the Cultural
        Revolution 文革.

        That experience influenced some of his best-known works, including the
        satirical Golden Age 《黃金時代》. Essay collections such as Silent
        Majority 《沉默的大多數》 exhibit his vernacular wit and talent for
        querying social norms.
