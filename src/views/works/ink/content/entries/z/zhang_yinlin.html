        His Outline of Chinese History 《中國史綱》 is an excellent introduction
        to ancient China, from the Xia dynasty through the Warring States period,
        unification under Qin Shihuang, and on to the establishment of the Eastern
        Han dynasty in the 1st century AD.

        The book is full of anecdotes on figures and events, and traces the
        emergence of China's philosophical schools, social customs, and political
        systems.
