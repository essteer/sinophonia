                Comic Collection</span></a> <span class="title-zh">創作業</span> is a Taiwanese publication that promotes
        local comic book artists. <span class="title-en">CCC</span> was
        established as a quarterly in 2009 as part of a broader initiative to foster creative works about
        Taiwan's culture and history.

        After a brief hiatus beginning in 2015, popular demand brought <span class="title-en">CCC</span> back as a
        monthly publication in 2017 and in 2020 it moved online to continue in digital format.
    </p>
    <p>
        Comics in <span class="title-en">CCC</span> exhibit a broad range of visual styles by the many different
        featured artists. Subject matter is
        equally varied in tone, from issues such as women's low social status in pre-modern Taiwan or the experience of
        indigenous people during colonisation, to contemporary themes, horror and sci-fi.
