        Zhang's works remain widely read in the Chinese-language world today, many
        of them focused on the 1930s to 1940s of the Republican era. She is
        perhaps best known overseas as the author of <span class="title-en">Lust, Caution</span><span
            class="title-zh">色，戒</span>&mdash;
        which Ang Lee <span class="person-zh">李安</span> adapted for the screen in 2007. Her novel <span class="title-en">Naked Earth</span><span
            class="title-zh">赤地戀愛</span>&mdash; one of few translated into
        English &mdash; depicts a young couple separated by Party bureaucracy and the Korean War.

        In addition to her fiction she was an active translator, and her research
        on Cao Xueqin's <span class="person-zh">曹雪芹</span> <span class="title-en">Dream of the Red Chamber</span><span class="title-zh">紅樓夢</span> is
        credited
        with having revived scholarly interest in the classic novel.
