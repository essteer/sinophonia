    <p>Chen Hsueh <span class="person-zh">陳雪</span> &mdash; born Chen Yaling <span class="person-zh">陳雅玲</span><sub
            class="life-date">1970</sub> &mdash; is a novelist and short story writer from Taiwan.</p>
    <p>
        Her 1995 collection <span class="title-en">Vile Girls Book</span><span class="title-zh">惡女書</span> explores its
        protagonists'
        struggles to accept their non-conventional sexuality amid strained family
        ties and social stigma.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strongest of the stories &mdash; <span class="title-en">Looking for Lost Angel Wings</span><span
            class="title-zh">尋找天使遺失的翅膀</span> and <span class="title-en">After the Cat Died</span><span
            class="title-zh">貓死了之後</span>&mdash; speak directly through first-person
        narratives, whereas the magical realist style of the other two seems to
        dilute the impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        In one passage of <span class="title-en">Night Maze</span><span class="title-zh">夜的迷宮</span> Chen composes
        across the page in
        rows and columns simultaneously, an unusual technique that gives a
        stream of consciousness-like feel. It would be interesting to see this
        developed to greater effect.

    <p>
        Since gaining infamy for the controversy of <span class="title-en">Vile Girls Book</span>, her debut
        work &mdash; published in a less tolerant Taiwan over two decades before it
        legalised same-sex marriage &mdash; Chen has spoken of her desire not to be
        typified as a genre writer. Chen is a prolific writer with several
        acclaimed full-length novels, some of which are on
        <a href="/works/ink/moreink">this list</a>.
