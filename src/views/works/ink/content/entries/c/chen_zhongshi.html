    <p>
        Chen Zhongshi <span class="person-zh">陳忠實</span> (1942 &mdash; 2016) was an author and the 1997 recipient of
        the <span class="title-en">Mao Dun Literature Prize</span><span class="title-zh">茅盾文學獎</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The novel that earned him recognition, <span class="title-en">White Deer Plain</span><span class="title-zh">白鹿原</span>,
        follows two rival families in rural Shaanxi province through the major
        upheavals of the first half of the 20th century. From the decline of the
        Qing Dynasty, through the establishment of the Republic of China, Japanese
        occupation and civil war, and the ultimate victory of the Communist Party,
        Chen depicts the conflicting interests and obligations that lead
        individuals to fateful decisions.

        The narrative complexity brings out the overwhelming uncertainty people
        endured during the period, and avoids any sense of a simple moral path to
        safety.
