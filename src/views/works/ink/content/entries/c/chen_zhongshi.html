  <p>
    Chen Zhongshi <span class="person-zh">陳忠實</span><sub class="life-date">1942-2016</sub> was an acclaimed author and
    the 1997 recipient of
    the <span class="title-en">Mao Dun Literature Prize</span><span class="title-zh">茅盾文學獎</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The novel that solidified his reputation was <span class="title-en">White Deer Plain</span><span
      class="title-zh">白鹿原</span>,
    which follows two rival families in rural Shaanxi province through the major
    upheavals of the first half of the 20<sup class="ordinal-indicator">th</sup> century.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the decline of the Qing dynasty <nobr>清朝</nobr><sub class="life-date">1644-1912</sub> through the
    establishment of the
    Republic of China <nobr>
      中華民國</nobr><sub class="life-date">1912-1949</sub>, Japanese
    occupation and civil war, and the ultimate victory of the Communist Party,
    Chen depicts how conflicting interests and obligations lead
    individuals to fateful decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chen's narrative complexity brings out the overwhelming uncertainty people
    endured during the period, and avoids any sense of there being a reliable path to safety. His realist approach
    serves up vivid characters whose relative virtues or lack thereof offer little indication of where events will cast
    them. Of those who remain by the end of the novel, knowledge of what their real life equivalents would experience in
    subsequent decades adds weight to his central theme of individuals' insignificance in the face of existential
    struggle.
