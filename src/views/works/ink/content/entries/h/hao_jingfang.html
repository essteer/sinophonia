      class="external-url title-en">Folding Beijing</a><span class="title-zh">北京摺曡</span> is a
    futuristic riff on the experiences of the eponymous city's
    <em>beipiao</em> 北漂 or migrant workers, whose labour is essential to its
    function, and yet must eke out precarious lives in a legal grey zone
    without basic rights.

    The urban future portrayed here is no less dystopian than that of <span class="title-en">Blade Runner</span>, but
    feels darker for how conceivable it is. Technological breakthrough hasn't led to replicants and galactic conflict,
    only to exacerbated wealth inequality and grim tedium for the working poor.
