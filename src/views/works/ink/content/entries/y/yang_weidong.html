        Yang Weidong <span class="person-zh">楊偉東</span> (1966 &mdash; ) is an artist and independent filmmaker.
        After suffering a politically-motivated family tragedy, he sought to
        understand how society could arrive at a state in which such acts occur
        without recourse.

    <p>
        The result is <span class="title-en">Put This On Record</span><span class="title-zh">立此存照</span>, a multi-volume
        series of
        over 500 interviews with prominent figures including officials,
        economists, historians, philosophers and activists across a spectrum of
        socio-political attitudes. Yang provides his subjects space to elucidate
        their thoughts, and humbly resists bringing his personal motivation into
        direct view.
