        To Live 《活著》 follows the hubristic descent into poverty of the
        arrogant son of a land-owning family. As the events of civil war, famine,
        and the Cultural Revolution unfold, the protagonist emerges with a kinder
        outlook even under increasing isolation.

        As a study of an individual, To Live makes a good compliment to Chen
        Zhongshi's 陳忠實 broader take on similar themes from that era in White
        Deer Plain 《白鹿原》.
