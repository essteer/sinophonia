        <span class="title-en">To Live</span><span class="title-zh">活著</span> follows the hubristic descent into poverty of the
        arrogant son of a land-owning family. As the events of civil war, famine,
        and the Cultural Revolution unfold, the protagonist emerges with a kinder
        outlook even under increasing isolation.

        As a study of an individual, <span class="title-en">To Live</span> makes a good compliment to Chen
        Zhongshi's <span class="person-zh">陳忠實</span> broader take on similar themes from that era in <span class="title-en">White
