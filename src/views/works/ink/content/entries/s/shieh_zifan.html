    <span class="title-en">Me and the Garbage Truck I Chased</span><span class="title-zh">我和我追逐的垃圾車</span> is a
    collection of autobiographical essays published in 2019, and divided across four themes: Hot &mdash; Cold &mdash;
    Dark
    &mdash; Light. The pieces draw on her experiences of familial and romantic relationships, workplace stress,
    unemployment, and loss.

    A theme that underpins several of the pieces is her struggle to cope with the death of her father,
    and the fallout this has on her mental health, with painful consequences for her personal and professional life.
    Shieh's
    restrained but
    reflective writing style gives depth to her subject matter and stays relatable throughout.
