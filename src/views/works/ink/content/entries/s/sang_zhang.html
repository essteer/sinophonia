        Sang Ye <span class="person-zh">嗓曄</span><sub class="life-date">1955</sub> is a journalist, writer and
        oral
        historian. Zhang Xinxin <span class="person-zh">張辛欣</span><sub class="life-date">1953</sub> is a writer,
        novelist and playwright.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1986 the pair published <span class="title-en">Chinese Lives</span><span
            class="title-zh-long">北京人：一百個普通人的自述</span>,
        a collection of interviews with people from a wide range of social, family, and
        occupational backgrounds in a country very different to today's People's Republic of China 中華人民共和國<sub
            class="life-date">1949</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Song and Zhang edited themselves out of the interviews, to present their
        subjects' accounts as uninterrupted monologues.
    </p>
    <p>
        I read the English translation ahead of my first visit to China, and found
        the authors' deeply humane treatment of their subjects' diverse and
        sometimes tragic experiences striking. I was fortunate to later track down
        a second-hand copy of the original Chinese text, but the translation is well worth reading if that's
        unavailable.

        Sang Ye published a further oral history titled <span class="title-zh">1949 1989 1999</span> which was later
        translated to English as <span class="title-en">China Candid: The People on the People's Republic</span>
        by Miriam Lang and <a href="#ChinaHeritage" class="external-url" target="_blank"><span
