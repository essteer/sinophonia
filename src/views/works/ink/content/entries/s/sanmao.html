        <span class="title-en">Stories of the Sahara</span><span class="title-zh">撒哈拉的故事</span> is typical of her
        autobiographical
        writing style, based on her experiences living in Morocco with her Spanish
        husband, who passed away in an accident just a few years after
        publication. Her struggles to cope with this loss informed much of her
        subsequent work, and likely contributed to her suicide a decade later.
