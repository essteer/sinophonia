        <span class="title-en">LEAP</span><span class="title-zh">藝術界</span> is a biannual, bilingual contemporary art
        and cultural commentary magazine, and self-stated 'international art portal of contemporary China'.
    </p>
    <p>The Shanghai-based publication extends its lens far across the rest of the country to cover exhibitions
        and performances from the visual arts scene, interviews, retrospectives and critical analysis of artists' works
        and themes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A notable feature of the magazine is that the print edition juxtaposes Chinese and English versions of each
        article, which can be especially useful as a
        learning tool for gleaning context from complex prose typical of more abstract subject matter.
