    <p>
        Lu Xun 魯迅 was the pseudonym of Zhou Shuren 周樹人 (1881 - 1936), a
        writer, essayist, and translator, who played a prominent role in the birth
        of modern Chinese literature.

        His short story collection Call to Arms 《呐喊》 is regarded as one of the
        first works written entirely in vernacular Chinese. It is worth reading
        for its historical significance alone, emerging in the aftermath of the
        1919 May Fourth Movement 五四運動 that saw widespread demonstrations
        against imperialism and calls for social modernisation.

        The collection includes the novella The True Story of Ah Q 《阿Q正傳》, a
        satire of backward character traits perceived as emblematic of how the
        country had fallen victim to the encroachment of foreign powers during the
        late Qing dynasty and early Republic of China period.
