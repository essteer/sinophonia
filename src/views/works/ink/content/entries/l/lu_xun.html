    <p>
        Lu Xun <span class="person-zh">魯迅</span> was the pseudonym of Zhou Shuren <span class="person-zh">周樹人</span> (1881 &mdash; 1936), a
        writer, essayist, and translator, who played a prominent role in the birth
        of modern Chinese literature.

        His short story collection <span class="title-en">Call to Arms</span><span class="title-zh">呐喊</span> is regarded as one of the
        first works written entirely in vernacular Chinese. It is worth reading
        for its historical significance alone, emerging in the aftermath of the
        1919 May Fourth Movement 五四運動 that saw widespread demonstrations
        against imperialism and calls for social modernisation.

        The collection includes the novella <span class="title-en">The True Story of Ah Q</span><span class="title-zh">阿Q正傳</span>, a
        satire of backward character traits perceived as emblematic of how the
        country had fallen victim to the encroachment of foreign powers during the
        late Qing dynasty and early Republic of China period.
