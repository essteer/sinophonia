    <p>
        Liao Wen-hao <span class="person-zh">廖文豪</span></span><sub class="life-date">1960</sub> is an assistant
        professor and library director of the National Taipei University of Business 國立臺北商業大學.
    </p>
    <p>
        Liao is the author of <span class="title-en">Hanzi Tree</span> <span class="title-zh">漢字樹</span>, a series of
        meticulously-researched books on the original meanings behind Chinese characters. Each
        volume uses vivid graphics to illustrate the genesis of hundreds of characters according to
        themes such as <span class="italic-en">people</span> or <span class="italic-en">plants</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In countless examples, Liao demonstrates how basic pictographs 象形字 are composed into ideographs that
        convey complex abstract concepts essential to any advanced society. He also addresses misconceptions regarding
        characters that have become
        corrupted over
        time &mdash; not least as a result of simplification &mdash; to present their true form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from the surface-level aspect of gaining deeper appreciation for the beauty of Chinese characters, the
        aggregate effect of Liao's work is to remind us of how intelligent this writing system is, as well as offer
        a sense of shared humanity via glimpses into the minds of its designers.
