        Liu Yichang 劉以鬯 (1918 &mdash; 2018) was a writer, editor and publisher, and
        one of the most prominent Hong Kong literary figures of the 20th century.
        Liu began as a newspaper editor and columnist during the Japanese
        occupation of China, and over the course of his prolific career continued
        on to serve publications in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.

        Credited as the first Chinese-language stream-of-consciousness novel, The
        Drunkard 《酒徒》 relates the perspective of a writer whose lamentations
        over the lack of an audience for serious literature in Hong Kong serve as
        an excuse for his descent into alcoholism, and rejection of his art form
        in favour of the easier income offered by pulp fiction and erotica.

        The vivid evocations of the streets and nightlife of 1960s Hong Kong bring
        to mind Henry Miller's Paris of the 1930s, though it is William Faulkner,
        James Joyce and Virginia Woolf to whom the protagonist makes repeated
        references and served as apparent inspiration to the author.

        Liu Yichang's work in turn has served as a major influence for acclaimed
        director Wong Kar Wai 王家衛; The Drunkard provided the inspiration for
        the latter's 2046, and his internationally renowned In the Mood for Love
        《花樣年華》 drew on another of Liu's works, Intersection 《對倒》.
