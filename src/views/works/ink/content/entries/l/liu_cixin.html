    <h2>Liu Cixin&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">劉慈欣</span></h2>
    <p>
        Liu Cixin 劉慈欣 (1963 &mdash; ) is a science fiction writer, former engineer,
        and recipient of the 2015 Hugo Award for Three Body Problem 《三體》, the
        first book of his trilogy by the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
        His engineering background shows in the descriptions of a near-future
        Earth trying desperately to develop technological solutions to an
        existential threat, and his application of game theory to space
        exploration in the second instalment, Dark Forest 《黑暗森林》, is
        engaging, as are the more experimental plotlines of the finale, Death's
        End 《死神永生》.
    </p>

        The narrative is let down by two-dimensional characters, and Liu's
        reliance on lazy stereotypes makes some sections tedious. Still, his
        strategic plot developments and talent for the science he knows is
        worthwhile for those interested in the genre.
