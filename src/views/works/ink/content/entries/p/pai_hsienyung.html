        Pai's <span class="title-en">Taipei People</span> <span class="title-zh">臺北人</span> is a collection of short stories about the eponymous city's residents, composed between the mid 1960s and early 1970s.

        Be it loved ones, livelihoods or places, each of the protagonists is scarred in some way by what was left behind, even as they differ in their ability to adapt to their new reality.

        Success in moving on seems to hinge on the insulation from the past that is afforded by youth or material wealth. Those less fortunate exist in denial with naive hopes to someday reclaim what was lost, or inhabit a state of detachment as they reflect on their former selves and how things used to be.
