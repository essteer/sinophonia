        Pai's <span class="title-en">Taipei People</span> <span class="title-zh">臺北人</span> is a collection of short stories about the eponymous city's residents, composed between the mid 1960s and early 1970s. Each narrative examines the personal losses experienced by those who crossed the strait to Taiwan in the events around the Chinese Communist Party's <nobr>中國共產黨</nobr> victory over the KMT in 1949.

        The theme and use of modernist techniques reflect the influence of James Joyce's<sub class="life-date">1882&mdash;1941</sub> <span class="title-en">Dubliners</span>, but Pai's work is its own masterpiece that melds intimate character portraits into a lament over deep collective trauma. The implications of this profound formational experience remain relevant to Taiwan today, as it increasingly emphasises its self-identity in the face of sustained threats from the mainland.
