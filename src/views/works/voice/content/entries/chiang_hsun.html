        With this 160-part series, Chiang Hsun <span class="person-zh">蔣勳</span> provides a detailed guide through
        <span class="title-en">Dream of the Red Chamber</span><span class="title-zh">紅樓夢</span>, the classic Qing
        dynasty 清朝<sub class="life-date">1644&mdash;1912</sub>
        novel by Cao Xueqin <span class="person-zh">曹雪芹</span><sub
        class="life-date">1715&mdash;1763</sub>.
    </p>

        A former professor of fine arts at Taiwan's Tunghai University 東海大學,
        Chiang proceeds through the novel from cover to cover, offering rich
        explanations of the cultural and historical context of the narrative,
        bringing it to life in vivid detail. The result is comparable to the late
        Frank Delaney's<sub class="life-date">1942&mdash;2017</sub> <a href="https://blog.frankdelaney.com/re-joyce/"
            class="external-url">exegesis</a>
        of James Joyce's<sub class="life-date">1882&mdash;1941</sub> <span class="title-en">Ulysses</span>,
        which sadly remains
        incomplete due to Delayney's passing in 2017.

        Chiang Hsun is an engaging speaker with deep knowledge of the subjects he
        covers here and elsewhere, and is enjoyable to listen to in his own right.

        Classical Chinese can be difficult to grasp even for native
        Chinese-language speakers today. <span class="title-en">Chiang Hsun on Dream of the Red Chamber</span><span
            class="title-zh">蔣勛細説紅樓夢</span>
        offers a good alternative to reading the novel directly, and would be a useful companion for non-native
        speakers interested in taking it on.
