        Launched in 2020, the hosts of <span class="title-en">Dagong Tan</span><span class="title-zh">打工談</span> &mdash; <span class="italic-en">"Labour
        Talks"</span> &mdash; spend time with manual labourers and people from other
        working-class professions, to discuss how they make their living, their
        perspective on their position in society, and obtacles they face in their
        work and personal lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hosts show genuine interest in getting to know their guests and
        portray their experiences with dignity, in defiance of the prevailing
        social mood towards the so-called <span class="italic-en">"low-end population"</span> 低端人口
        responsible for the PRC's prosperity.
