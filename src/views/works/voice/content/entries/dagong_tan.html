    Over 46 episodes released between 2020 and 2023, the hosts of <span class="title-en">Dagong Tan</span><span
      class="title-zh">打工談</span> &mdash; <span class="italic-en">'Labour
      Talks'</span> &mdash; spend time with manual labourers and people from other working-class professions to discuss
    how they make their living, the social status of rural and blue-collar workers, and the struggles they face in their
    work and personal lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hosts show genuine empathy towards their guests, who are given room to voice
    their experiences with a dignity that contrasts with the prevailing social mood towards the so-called <span

  </p>

    Elsewhere the discourse on this major social segment typically reflects official narratives, or takes place in
    narrow economic terms. <span class="italic-en">Dagong Tan</span> engages with the lived reality of labour as endured
    by the workers themselves,
    offering sober accounts of the often exploitative nature of work in the People's Republic.
