    Begun in mid-2022,
    <a href="https://www.bumingbai.net/" class="external-url"><span class="title-en">Bu Mingbai</span></a>
    <span class="title-zh">不明白</span> is the personal project of a group of professional
    journalists, hosted by <span class="title-en">New York Times</span> reporter Yuan Li <span
      class="person-zh">袁莉</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the words of its creators, the <span class="title-en">Bu Mingbai</span> podcast <span class="quote">"hopes to
      share
      interesting conversations with a global Chinese-language audience, to
      shine a little light and warmth during this dark and chaotic era."</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Yuan Li interviews guests from a range of professional and social
    backgrounds to discuss their views on current affairs involving the PRC. Episodes last around an hour, and at the
    end of each conversation guests are invited to share book recommendations, making it a good source for reading
    suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
    One entry in a slightly different format is episode 12, <span class="title-en">Twists and Turns
      in the Chinese Nation's World Entrance</span>
    <span class="title-zh">傳統中國人認識世界的曲折和挫折</span> in which Fudan University 復旦大學 historian <a href="/ink#GeZhaoguang"
      class="internal-url">Ge
      Zhaoguang</a> <span class="person-zh">葛兆光</span> delivers a seminar on the title subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notable recurring guests of the series include political scientists Cai Xia <span class="person-zh">蔡霞</span> and
    Minxin Pei <span class="person-zh">裴敏欣</span>, and Stanford research scholars Xu Chenggang <span
      class="person-zh">許成鋼</span> and Wu Guoguang <span class="person-zh">吳國光</span>. They are joined by a host of
    other prominent figures as well as members of the general public, who are sometimes anonymised to protect their
    identities when discussions touch on sensitive topics.
