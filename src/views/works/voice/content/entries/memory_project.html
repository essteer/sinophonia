    In 2010, documentary filmmaker Wu Wenguang <span class="person-zh">吳文光</span> launched <span class="title-en"><a
        href="https://chinesememoryproject.org/" class="external-url">The Memory Project</a></span> to collect oral
    histories from survivors of the Great Famine 三年大饑荒 that swept the Chinese
    countryside between 1958 to 1961, resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of rural inhabitants.

    The project has grown to involve the collaboration of over 150 filmmakers and more than 1,100 interviewees
    across hundreds of villages in 20 provinces, and thus presents an immense record of the countless personal tragedies
    that took place during the period, and which manifested to varying degrees according to differences in geography and
    policy. The subject focus has also since expanded to include other contemporaneous periods of national turmoil such
    as the
    Great Leap Forward 大躍進<sub class="life-date">1958-1960</sub> and the Cultural Revolution 文化大革命<sub
      class="life-date">1966-1976</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project's <a href="https://chinesememoryproject.org/" class="external-url">official website</a> hosts a
    selection of featured interviews and related materials such as a timeline of key events and a map of interview
    locations. A larger body of the video interviews &mdash; numbering over
    700 to date &mdash; is maintained at the digital collection of <a href="https://idn.duke.edu/ark:/87924/r4qb9xm34"
      class="external-url">Duke University Libraries</a>.
