  <p>
    With its 800<sup class="ordinal-indicator">th</sup> episode released in mid-2024, it is an incredible resource that
    provides a platform for voices across
    the spectrum of human experience.
    The series has garnered critical acclaim and considerable popularity for the quality of its production and the
    consistently engaging oral histories in its extensive backlog.

    Following an initial introduction to the guest speaker and the story they will share, the interviewers' questions
    are
    typically edited out of each recording to give a sense of an uninterrupted monologue by
    each guest. Most episodes run from 20 to 40 minutes, with occasional longer stories split across several recordings.
