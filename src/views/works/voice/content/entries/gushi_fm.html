        Created by journalist Kou Aizhe <span class="person-zh">寇愛哲</span> in 2017,
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/world/asia/china-podcast-gushi-fm.html" class="external-url" target="_blank"><span class="title-en">Gushi
            FM</span></a>
            <span class="title-zh">故事FM</span> is a podcast series that relays personal narratives from ordinary
        people in their own words. With its 700th episode released in early 2023,
        it is an incredible resource that provides a platform for voices across
        the spectrum of human experience.

        Recorded as interviews, the podcast team's questions are largely edited
        out to leave an uninterrupted monologue told by each guest. Most episodes
        run from 20 to 40 minutes.
