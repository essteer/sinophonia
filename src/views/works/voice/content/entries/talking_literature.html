        <span class="title-zh">跳島FM</span> is a weekly literature podcast launched in March 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discussions dive into the works of different authors and genres, political
        and social themes reflected in writing, and technical areas such as the
        difficulties involved in translation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zhong Na <span class="person-zh">鍾娜</span> and Xiao Li <span class="person-zh">小李</span> are the main hosts,
        though the series has
        an open format and shows are often led by other writers, critics and
        translators.
    </p>
    <p>
        The series has good coverage of modern Chinese literature, so is a great
        place to pick up reading recommendations or learn more about the context
        of literary movements and writers' works.
