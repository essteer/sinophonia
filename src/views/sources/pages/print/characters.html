<h2 class="h2-flex">Character Variants&nbsp;<span class="chinese-heading">繁體與簡體</span></h2>
<p>
    Depending on how and where you learnt to read Chinese, you may be familiar
    with either traditional <nobr>繁體字</nobr> or simplified characters <nobr>簡體字.</nobr>
</p>
<p>
    The latter are officially used in the People's Republic of China and
    Singapore; traditional characters are still going strong in Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, 
    Taiwan, and across much of the global diaspora.

<p>
    I recommend learning traditional characters to get the most out of the
    written language in its intended form.

<p>
    If you began with simplified characters and want to learn
    traditional &mdash; or vice versa &mdash; flashcard apps that use <span class="italic-en">spaced repetition</span> can get you up to speed with
    the other form in a short period of time. See the <span class="italic-en">Study Tools</span> section
    of <a href="/sources#Tools">SOURCES</a> for details.
