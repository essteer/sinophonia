    <a href="https://lang-8.com/" class="external-url">Lang-8</a> is a platform for improving writing
    skills in foreign languages.
</p>
<p>
    Users write entries in their target language, and native speakers then
    correct mistakes and provide feedback &mdash; the more entries you work on
    in your native language, the more likely your own entries will receive
    corrections.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately Lang-8 no longer accepts new registrations, but the same
    company has an app called
    <a href="https://hinative.com/" class="external-url">HiNative</a> that
    appears to offer similar features.
