    <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" class="external-url" target="_blank">Anki</a> is flashcard software that uses spaced repetition to deliver a powerful memorisation tool. Much has been
    written on the benefits of this approach &mdash; see <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/" class="external-url" target="_blank">here</a>
    for a brief introduction, and <a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition" class="external-url">here</a> for a more in-depth exploration of the technique.
</p>
<p>
    Spaced repetition lends itself to all kinds of subjects &mdash; it's popular
    with medical students for learning clinical terms &mdash; and is especially
    useful for building vocabulary in a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
    Use Anki either to download flashcard decks created by others, or build your own
    over time and add new terms as you come across them.
</p>
<p>
    Anki is free on desktop systems and Android, but there is a one-off
    fee for the iPhone version.
