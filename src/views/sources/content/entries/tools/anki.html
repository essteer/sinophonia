<p>
    Anki is a flashcard platform that uses spaced repition software &mdash; see
    Benny Lewis'
    <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/" class="external-url" target="_blank">explainer</a>
    if you're new to the concept.
</p>
<p>
    It can be used for all kinds of subjects &mdash; it's supposedly popular
    with medical students for learning clinical terms &mdash; and is especially
    useful for building vocabulary in a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
    Either download flashcard decks created by others, or build your own
    over time and add new terms as you come across them.
</p>
<p>
    Anki is free on desktop systems and Android, but there is a one-off
    fee for the iPhone version.
