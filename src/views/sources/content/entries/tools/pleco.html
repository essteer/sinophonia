    <a href="https://www.pleco.com/" class="external-url" target="_blank">Pleco</a> is a Chinese dictionary app,
    available on major app stores. The free version is excellent, and the premium
    version is well worth the price.
</p>
<p>
    You can easily view definitions from multiple dictionaries at once,
    including several with definitions in Chinese &mdash; useful for an immersive
    approach. The app has audio support, example sentences, and a
    flashcard function.
</p>
<p>
    I began using Pleco over a decade ago for Mandarin, and still use it
    on a daily basis for that and more recently Cantonese as well.
</p>
<p>
    It is without doubt the single most useful tool I have made use of,
    and has made the process of learning to read and expand vocabulary far
    more smooth and enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.
