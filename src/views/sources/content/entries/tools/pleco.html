    Pleco is a Chinese dictionary app, available on the App Store and
    Google Play. The free version is excellent, and the premium version is
    well worth the price.
</p>
<p>
    You can easily view definitions from multiple dictionaries at once,
    including several with definitions in Chinese (useful for an immersive
    approach). The app has audio support, example sentences, and a
    flashcard function.

<p>
    I began using Pleco over a decade ago for Mandarin, and still use it
    on a daily basis for that and more recently Cantonese as well.
</p>
<p>
    It is without doubt the single most useful tool I have made use of,
    and has made the process of learning to read and expand vocabulary far
    more smooth and enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.
