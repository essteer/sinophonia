    <a href="https://www.italki.com/" class="external-url">iTalki</a> is a platform for connecting
    language teachers and students for online lessons.
</p>
<p>
    For popular languages there are many teachers available across
    different time zones and a range of budgets, and it's often possible
    to have a trial lesson with a teacher first before committing to more
    time with them.
</p>
<p>
    The site used to offer a free language exchange option, where users
    could find partners to practice conversation in their native
    languages.
</p>
<p>
    That seems to no longer be available, but would be worth seeking out
    on another platform &mdash; free conversation practice from anywhere in the
    world and the chance to make friends in your target language is an
    incredible thing.
