      Notes on Sinophonia
    </h6>
    <p>
      <span id="name">XUANZANG</span> <span class="chinese-heading">玄奘</span> is an ongoing project to highlight
      creators of significant Chinese-language works and output in various forms, and sources of related social
      commentary.
    </p>
    <p><span class="title-en">Sinophonia</span> above is posited as a catch-all term for these cultural expressions,
      to imply a shared language but make no assumptions of a common perspective or aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandarin is the predominant medium here by demographic inevitability, but there's a limited
      Cantonese selection and plans to feature more works beyond these in time.

      Modern literature is the main focus of <span id="name">INK</span> <span class="chinese-heading">墨</span> but
      economics, history, politics and sociology also feature, as do several excellent online archives
      that cover an extensive range of essays, journals and records of documentary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio content in <span id="name">VOICE</span> <span class="chinese-heading">嗓</span> includes podcast series that vary in
      scope from oral histories and political commentary, to philosophy and pop culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content is chosen from what I've personally read or listened to, and typically included based on cultural
      significance, entertainment value, social or historical insight, or a combination of these factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's inevitable that many excellent creators and works have been overlooked here &mdash; ping feedback and
      suggestions to <nobr><a href="mailto:elliott@xuan-zang.com" class="external-url" target="_blank">
